 *
 * Runs a test to find a the cardboard vision target. Will be expanded to involve
 * controlling one or more servos to center the target.
 *
 * Will also be tested to become more accurate at finding the target in bright light.
 * currently performs fantastic in the dark with just the reflected target for obvious
 * reasons.
